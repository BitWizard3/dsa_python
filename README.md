  🌱 Welcome to my open-source notebook for learning Data Structures & Algorithms. <br/>
  📚 Each folder represents a DSA topic with hand-written notes, problem breakdowns, and Python solutions. <br/>
  💡 My goal: to build a strong foundation while sharing and helping others grow along the way.

## ✨ Why This Repository?

> _"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." – Albert Einstein_

This repository serves as my personal roadmap through the world of DSA — carefully curated and organized with:
- 🧠 **Concise, readable notes** explaining core concepts
- 🧩 **Problem statements** with intuitive walkthroughs
- 🐍 **Python implementations** that are clean, commented, and beginner-friendly

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up for interviews, I hope this becomes a **go-to reference** you can learn from too!
